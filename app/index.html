Swapify is an app built with React and Redux, and outputs a checkout that is fully ready to process global transactions. My focus on this project was on the checkout that gets generated, and making sure the process from the Swapify app to cleverbridge checkout is as seamless as possible.</p>

The students made portfolio sites along the way and completed coding exercises.

					        <p>Hack to the Future was the second event of the cleverbridge hackathon series. It was an event that brought together Chicago-area developers of all skill levels and educators to develop tools that extend learning both inside and outside the classroom. The goal of the hackathon was to create a website or application that would increase the Chicago Public Schools graduation rate. Each team had at least one educator, and the developers and educators collaborated together to produce a project that would help students learn, regardless of resources. Hack to the Future had a huge impact on the community and created additional opportunities for cleverbridge and the rest of the Chicago tech community to work with Chicago Public Schools. <a href="https://hacktothefuture.splashthat.com/" target="_blank" class="read-more">Read More <span>&rsaquo;</span></a></p>

					        <p class="date">October 2015</p>
					        <p>She Hacks Chi was the first cleverbridge hackathon, and was aimed to close the gender gap in tech. We brought together beginner and intermediate coders together with experienced developers to hack in a supportive environment. The teams built an application, website, or game that would get girls ages 8-15 interested in STEM. Not only were the projects aimed at getting women in tech, but the hackathon itself provided she-coders with opportunities to network, design, and build innovative websites and applications that would have a direct impact on the female development community in Chicago. Every team produced a successful project, and many of the event participants still keep in touch throughout the Chicago tech community. <a href="https://shehackschi.splashthat.com/" target="_blank" class="read-more">Read More <span>&rsaquo;</span></a></p>
